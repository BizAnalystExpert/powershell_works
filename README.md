For recurring processes, powershell scripts can help put all steps on the same page.  End user can execute one line at a time and watch the result instantly.  Or select code to execute.  All variables are retained by default and that makes for easy debugging.

Use powershell to call programs and capure output.

Powershell is my favorite tool to deliver one click solution.
